# Homework 8: Artificial Neural Networks with PyTorch
 
https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/homeworks/homework8.html

## Goal
This homework focuses on becoming familiar with the PyTorch deep learning platform through a tutorial on a benchmark machine learning dataset.
The assignment must be done using Python only. Do all of your work in the provided iPython notebook.

## Problems

Download the Python Notebook [here](http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs498aml/sp2019/homeworks/HW8.ipynb). Alternatively, you can access a read-only version on colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/136uMrN7hI2pQ1lclUxjc1KRvIlSZjQLT) of which you will need to make a copy.
There are cells for you to input code, as well as text. Make sure to fill in all such cells before submission. Important information and sections are in bold.
You will need to produce plots during training using tensorboard. All training/testing plots for this homework will be produced using tensorboard . For each model, you produce the loss per batch and accuracy per batch on the training set, and the loss per epoch and accuracy per epoch on the test/validation set. You can put the data for both models on the same plot but there needs to be at least 4 plots.
